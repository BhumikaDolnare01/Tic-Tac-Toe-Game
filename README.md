# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
<h1> Tic Tac Toe - My First Mini Project! ðŸŽ‰</h1>

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

This is my very first mini-project: a classic game of Tic Tac Toe!

## How to Play

It's just regular Tic Tac Toe! Two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks (either X or O) in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins! If all the spaces are filled and no one has three in a row, it's a draw.

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand things like:

* Getting user input
* Using loops to keep the game going
* Checking for winning conditions
* Keeping track of the game board
* Maybe a little bit about organizing my code!


## Next Steps (Maybe?)

* Maybe I'll add a simple computer opponent someday!
* Or make the board look a bit nicer.

## Thanks for Checking It Out! ðŸ˜Š

Let me know if you have any feedback.
